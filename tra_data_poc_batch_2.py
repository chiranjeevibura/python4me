With large datasets like 17 million records in Oracle and 230 million in Teradata, joining in Spark requires optimizations to avoid memory constraints and performance bottlenecks. Here’s a refined approach, keeping production-level considerations in mind:

### Optimized Approach

1. **Partitioning and Batching**: Instead of loading and joining all records at once, divide the Oracle dataset into manageable partitions (e.g., 1 million records per batch) based on a unique or indexed field such as `app_ref_no`. Each partition will be joined with the full Teradata dataset but will process fewer records at a time.
   
2. **Broadcast Join (if possible)**: If the Oracle dataset is significantly smaller than the Teradata dataset, broadcasting the Oracle dataset can optimize the join. Since 17 million records is on the edge for broadcasting, test this approach and fall back to the partitioned join if needed.

3. **Predicate Pushdown**: Use predicates to filter data at the database level before loading it into Spark. This ensures that only necessary records are fetched and reduces data transfer.

4. **Incremental Write to CSV**: Write results in a streaming-like manner (batch-wise) to avoid accumulating all data in memory before writing to disk.

5. **Resource Configurations**: Allocate adequate resources, like increasing executor memory and cores, and tuning Spark configurations for shuffle operations to manage data-intensive tasks effectively.

### Optimized Code Implementation

Here’s how you could apply these optimizations in code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

# Initialize Spark session with resource configurations
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Source_Target_Join_Optimized") \
    .config("spark.executor.memory", "8g") \
    .config("spark.executor.cores", "4") \
    .config("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "400") \
    .config("spark.jars", "/path_to_jdbc_driver/ojdbc8.jar,/path_to_jdbc_driver/terajdbc4.jar") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Oracle JDBC connection details
oracle_jdbc_url = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@<oracle_host>:<port>/<service_name>"
oracle_properties = {
    "user": "<oracle_username>",
    "password": "<oracle_password>",
    "driver": "oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver",
    "fetchSize": "10000"  # Use an optimized fetch size
}

# Teradata JDBC connection details
teradata_jdbc_url = "jdbc:teradata://<teradata_host>/LOGMECH=LDAP"
teradata_properties = {
    "user": "<teradata_username>",
    "password": "<teradata_password>",
    "driver": "com.teradata.jdbc.TeraDriver",
    "fetchSize": "10000"
}

# Partition batch size
batch_size = 1000000  # 1 million records per batch

# Step 1: Load Oracle source data (17 million records) in partitions
total_source_records = 17000000  # Assume we know the total record count
source_df = None

for i in range(0, total_source_records, batch_size):
    # Adjust the range for each partition/batch to filter Oracle data
    source_batch_df = spark.read.jdbc(
        oracle_jdbc_url,
        "(SELECT * FROM source_table WHERE rownum BETWEEN {start} AND {end}) AS source_batch".format(
            start=i + 1,
            end=min(i + batch_size, total_source_records)
        ),
        properties=oracle_properties
    ).select("app_ref_no")  # Select only necessary columns for joining
    
    # Load full Teradata target data (230 million records) once
    if source_df is None:
        target_df = spark.read.jdbc(
            teradata_jdbc_url,
            "target_table",
            properties=teradata_properties
        ).select("app_ref_no", "other_field1", "other_field2")

    # Step 3: Perform inner join on app_ref_no
    result_batch_df = source_batch_df.join(target_df, "app_ref_no", "inner")
    
    # Step 4: Write the result of each batch to a CSV in pipe-separated format
    result_batch_df.write \
        .option("delimiter", "|") \
        .option("header", "true") \
        .mode("append") \
        .csv("/path_to_output_directory/result_output.csv")

# Stop Spark session
spark.stop()
```

### Explanation of Optimizations

1. **Batching**: By processing 1 million records from Oracle at a time, we reduce memory pressure and avoid overwhelming Spark with a massive join operation.

2. **Selective Load for Oracle**: The `rownum` filtering in each batch fetches only 1 million rows per iteration. This way, we don’t load all 17 million Oracle records at once but process them batch by batch.

3. **Single Load for Teradata**: Since Teradata holds the larger dataset, we load it once. Spark will hold it in memory, optimizing performance by avoiding repeated reads.

4. **Pipe-Separated CSV Write with Append Mode**: Writing each batch’s result to the CSV file in append mode ensures that the data isn’t kept in memory, reducing memory usage and making the process more stable for large-scale data.

5. **Resource Allocation**: Increasing executor memory and cores allows Spark to handle large joins better, especially with shuffle-intensive operations.

This approach should help in efficiently processing large datasets in a production environment by managing memory effectively and minimizing the load on both Spark and the databases.
