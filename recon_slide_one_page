Title: Reconciliation Process Overview
Step-by-Step Breakdown:
Read batch information: Fetch BATCHID, BATCH_START_DATE, and BATCH_END_DATE from the Oracle batch table.
Query source Oracle database: Retrieve document count within the specified date range.
Query target MongoDB database: Retrieve document count within the specified date range.
Compare key columns: Compare DOMAIN, DIVISION, SUBDIVISION, CUSTREFKEY, CUSTREFValue, and EXTREFKEY, EXTREFValue between source and target data.
Document validation: Randomly sample documents and validate their existence in Hitachi Content Platform.
Update reconciliation status: Update SparkReconBatchTable with counts, comparison results, and validation results.

Understanding the Task
We aim to compare specific columns in two PySpark DataFrames: source_df and target_df. The goal is to identify discrepancies between these columns.

Explanation
Create DataFrames: We create sample DataFrames source_df and target_df with the specified columns.
Full Outer Join: We perform a full outer join on the comparison columns. This will include all records from both DataFrames, with null values for columns that don't match.
Identify Mismatches: We filter the joined DataFrame based on mismatched id columns. This indicates records that exist in one DataFrame but not the other, or where the values for the comparison columns differ.

comparison_df = source_df.join(target_df, ["DOMAIN", "DIVISION", "CUSTREFKEY", "CUSTREFValue", "EXTREFKEY", "EXTREFValue"], how="full_outer")

# Identify records that exist in one DataFrame but not the other
mismatch_count = comparison_df.filter((comparison_df["id"] != comparison_df["id"])).count()
print("Mismatch count:", mismatch_count)

# Further analysis can be done based on the comparison_df

We aim to randomly sample documents from a PySpark DataFrame, extract a relevant field (e.g., HCP storage path), and validate the existence of the corresponding document in the Hitachi Content Platform (HCP).

Explanation
Create Sample DataFrame: We create a sample DataFrame with columns id, document_name, and HCP_storage_path.
Random Sampling: We randomly sample 10% of the DataFrame using sample.
Extract HCP Paths: We extract the HCP_storage_path column into a Python list.
Validate Documents: Iterate over the HCP paths, calling validate_document for each path.
Return Results: Return a list of tuples containing the HCP path and validation status.


Understanding the Task
We aim to retrieve document counts within a specified date range from both an Oracle database and a MongoDB collection.

Explanation
Function Definition: The get_document_counts function takes the start and end dates as input and returns a tuple containing the source and target counts.
Oracle Query: Constructs a SQL query to count documents within the specified date range in the Oracle database. Uses pandas.read_sql to execute the query and extract the count.
MongoDB Query: Constructs a MongoDB aggregation pipeline to count documents within the specified date range. Uses PySpark's MongoDB connector to execute the query and extract the count.
Return Values: Returns the source_count and target_count as a tuple.
