You're absolutely right to consider performance optimization, scalability, and efficient data handling, given the large volume of records across Oracle and Teradata databases. Below is a refined strategy and code that incorporates expert-level programming practices and performance optimizations for handling the data efficiently.

Performance Optimizations Strategy
Minimize Data Movement:

We will ensure that filtering is done at the source (Teradata and Oracle) as much as possible before bringing the data into Spark, reducing the need for large-scale data movement.
Partitioning and Parallel Processing:

Leverage partitioning in both Teradata and Spark to parallelize processing.
For large Teradata tables (230M records), we'll use predicate pushdown and filtering at the query level.
Use coalesce/repartition effectively in Spark to optimize shuffle operations.
Incremental/Batch Processing:

Given the size of the data, batch processing (especially for Teradata queries) is crucial. We can define the batch size based on the Spark cluster capacity and memory available.
Efficient Joins with Broadcast:

If the 17M records from Oracle are smaller than Teradata datasets, use broadcast joins to filter large datasets efficiently.
Teradata Partitioning:

Use appropriate partitioning on Teradata when querying large tables based on APP_REF_NO or PROD_ACCT_NO to avoid full table scans.

Breakdown of Optimizations
Data Filtering at Source:

Queries for VCARD_CNS_US.APP_CUST_REF_AUD and VCARD_SMB_NA.ACCT_STAT_CT use WHERE conditions to only bring relevant data (matching APP_REF_NO or PROD_ACCT_NO), reducing the amount of data transferred to Spark.
Repartitioning:

We've repartitioned the data (oracle_df, cust_ref_df, acct_med_chg_df, acct_stat_ct_df) based on the keys used in joins (APP_REF_NO, PROD_ACCT_NO), ensuring that Spark can efficiently distribute the workload across its executors.
Predicate Pushdown:

Queries push down filtering conditions to Teradata, ensuring that only the necessary data is processed, reducing I/O operations.
Broadcast Join:

For small tables (17M records from Oracle compared to 230M records in Teradata), we can use broadcast(oracle_df) for efficient joining, especially when filtering down large datasets.
Partitioning in Teradata Queries:

Queries for Teradata are designed to use selective filtering (APP_REF_NO, PROD_ACCT_NO, ACCT_ID) rather than performing full table scans, which significantly reduces I/O costs.
Batch Processing:

Since we are working with large datasets, the Teradata queries are executed in partitions, and Spark handles parallel processing across multiple nodes.
Additional Considerations
Incremental Processing: If handling the full dataset at once still causes performance bottlenecks, break down the execution into smaller batches by using APP_REF_NO ranges, and process data in parallel.

Tuning Spark Configurations: Tuning parameters like spark.executor.memory, spark.executor.cores, and spark.sql.shuffle.partitions based on the cluster size and dataset helps ensure optimal performance.

This optimized approach ensures that large-scale data movement is minimized, and the workload is distributed across both Teradata and Spark clusters efficiently, leading to a scalable and performant solution.
