Yes, you can use the `create_collection` method from the `pymongo` library to create a collection with validation rules. Here is an example of how you can define a schema for your collection and create a collection with validation rules using the `create_collection` method:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
from pymongo.errors import OperationFailure

# Define your validation schema
validation_schema = {
    "$jsonSchema": {
        "bsonType": "object",
        "required": ["employeeId", "firstName", "lastName", "dateOfBirth", "gender", "family"],
        "properties": {
            "employeeId": {
                "bsonType": "int",
                "description": "The unique identifier for an employee"
            },
            "firstName": {
                "bsonType": "string",
                "description": "The first name of the employee"
            },
            "lastName": {
                "bsonType": "string",
                "description": "The last name of the employee"
            },
            "dateOfBirth": {
                "bsonType": "string",
                "description": "The date of birth of the employee"
            },
            "gender": {
                "bsonType": "string",
                "description": "The gender of the employee"
            },
            "family": {
                "bsonType": "object",
                "required": ["spouseName", "spouseDateOfBirth", "kidsNames"],
                "properties": {
                    "spouseName": {
                        "bsonType": "string",
                        "description": "The name of the spouse"
                    },
                    "spouseDateOfBirth": {
                        "bsonType": "string",
                        "description": "The date of birth of the spouse"
                    },
                    "kidsNames": {
                        "bsonType": "array",
                        "description": "The names of the kids",
                        "items": {
                            "bsonType": "string"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient()

# Get a reference to the target database
db = client["YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"]

# Define the options for creating the collection
options = {"validator": validation_schema}

# Create the collection with validation rules
try:
    db.create_collection("employees", **options)
    print("Collection created with validation rules.")
except OperationFailure as e:
    print(f"Error creating collection: {e.details}")
```

In this example, we define a schema for the `employees` collection that includes validation rules for each field. We then use the `create_collection` method to create the collection with the specified validation rules. If the validation rules are not met when inserting or updating documents in the collection, MongoDB will reject the operation and raise an error.

Keep in mind that the validation schema defined here is for demonstration purposes only and may need to be adjusted to meet the specific requirements of your application. Additionally, MongoDB allows for more advanced validation rules using JSON Schema. For more information, refer to the MongoDB documentation on JSON Schema validation.
