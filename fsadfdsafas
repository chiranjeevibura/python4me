Subject: Update on Planned Vacation Dates and Apology for Delayed Communication

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide an update regarding our previous discussion about utilizing carry-over vacation days before March 31st.

Initially, we had planned to use these days during the last week of March. However, due to a scheduled training plan during that period, we have decided to use the vacation days from March 18th to 22nd instead. I apologize for not updating you in person about this change earlier, and I understand the inconvenience this may cause.

I kindly request your approval to take the planned vacation days during the week of March 18th to 22nd. Your understanding in this matter is greatly appreciated.

Additionally, I look forward to meeting you in Dallas and receiving your guidance on our CDL and other ongoing efforts to take them to the next level.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
