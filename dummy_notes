**Subject:** October Infra Release - Dark Period Request for Spark Migration Preparation

Hi 

As we prepare for the Spark migration release scheduled for November, I wanted to request going dark during the October infrastructure release to focus on critical prerequisites for the upcoming release. 

The release item contains the following tasks:
1. **Create a new MongoDB and Collection** - Spark/BankDocumentStage to serve as the staging area for document migration.
2. **Execute all three Spark migration jobs** - This includes Batch Creation, Migration, and Reconciliation.
3. **Perform end-to-end validation** of the migration process.
4. **Move a few documents to the CDL/BankDocument collection** to allow the LOB to validate the migrated documents.
5. **Ensure all logs appear in Splunk** for audit and tracking purposes.
6. **Enable monitoring in Dynatrace** for the Spark migration jobs.

This is a critical prerequisite for the November release, ensuring that our jobs are ready, fail-proof, and allow early LOB validation on the migrated data.

Please let me know if you need any further details or have concerns about going dark in the October release.

Best regards,
